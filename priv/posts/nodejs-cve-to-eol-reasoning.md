# Why Node.js Issues CVEs for End-of-Life Versions

On January 21, 2025, Node.js released a security patch affecting four active release lines of Node.js.
However, with this release, the Node.js team also issued CVEs for End-of-Life (EOL) versions of Node.js:

- **CVE-2025-23087** targets Node.js v17 and all prior versions (starting with v0.x).
- **CVE-2025-23088** targets Node.js v19.
- **CVE-2025-23089** targets Node.js v21.

Moving forward, Node.js will continue issuing CVEs for subsequent EOL versions.

This approach was previously discussed and announced on the [Node.js blog](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/upcoming-cve-for-eol-versions).
The intent is to raise awareness among users that running an EOL version of Node.js is dangerous,
as it **contains** numerous unpatched vulnerabilities.

Unsurprisingly, the security community has debated whether issuing CVEs for EOL versions is necessary or
philosophically acceptable. This post aims to clarify the Node.js perspective and the reasoning behind this decision.

## Why Node.js Doesn't Check Reports Against EOL Versions

Some critics argue that Node.js should evaluate security reports against EOL versions and include them in
CVE version ranges. However, the answer to this is straightforward: Node.js is maintained by volunteers.
Currently, there are over 20 EOL versions of Node.js, each with different dependencies, versions of V8, build methods,
and supported platforms. Checking whether every vulnerability affects these versions is neither sustainable nor practical.

Setting a threshold for the last N LTS EOL versions could also lead to errors. When a vulnerability report is submitted to
Node.js via HackerOne, the team ensures the issue is applicable across all active release lines but
excludes EOL versions entirely. Attempting to include EOL versions could result in false negatives, as vulnerabilities may
manifest differently depending on the version and its dependencies (e.g., OpenSSL).

In other words, evaluating reports against EOL versions would require resources far beyond the project’s capacity.
Node.js operates primarily through volunteer efforts, and even with its existing funding,
resources are focused on keeping current releases secure.

As Matteo Collina summarized:

> Why did the Node.js project emit a CVE for all EOL releases? Because we don’t have the resources to evaluate every single past release to know what is vulnerable.
>
> For all of you that are asking, Node.js is run by volunteers. We have enough funding to maintain the current releases safe, but nothing more.
>
> In other words, we are 100% certain that all those past releases of Node.js are vulnerable, or will soon be vulnerable. This CVE now will raise the awareness of this security risk to your organization.

## The Node.js Intention with These CVEs

Some security experts question whether CVEs are the "correct" method for informing users about EOL software.
While we welcome philosophical debates, issuing CVEs was the most effective way to achieve our primary goal: reaching Node.js users directly.

In typical scenarios, users run security scans on their production applications. If they’re using an active version
that recently received a security patch, the scanner will flag it, prompting an upgrade. However, if they’re using an
EOL version and the CVE doesn’t include it in the version range, they might mistakenly assume their software is safe.

For context, the Node.js Technical Steering Committee (TSC) has long discussed the ongoing issue of users massively
downloading EOL versions of Node.js. As noted in the [Node.js announcement](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/upcoming-cve-for-eol-versions):

> Node.js v16, despite being EOL for over a year, still has 11 million downloads per month.

Issuing CVEs is the most direct way to alert companies and users running outdated versions of Node.js
that they are likely vulnerable.
