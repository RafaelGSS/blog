# Why Node.js Issues CVEs for End-of-Life Versions

On January 21, 2025, Node.js released security patches for four active release lines. In conjunction, CVEs were published for EOL versions:

- **CVE-2025-23087** covers Node.js v17 and all prior versions (including v0.x).
- **CVE-2025-23088** covers Node.js v19.  
- **CVE-2025-23089** covers Node.js v21.

Following the release of these CVEs, several questions arose. This post provides additional details on the reasoning and intent behind issuing CVEs for EOL versions.

## Why Node.js Does Not Review EOL Versions

The project does not evaluate security reports against EOL versions or include them in CVE version ranges.
The primary reason is resource limitations. Node.js is largely maintained by volunteers, and there are more than
20 EOL releases, each with distinct dependencies, build methods, and platform support. Assessing vulnerabilities
across all of these versions is neither feasible nor sustainable.

Creating a threshold for reviewing a limited subset of EOL releases could also result in inaccurate conclusions.
Vulnerabilities may manifest differently depending on underlying components (e.g., OpenSSL). Attempting to assess
EOL versions would require additional resources beyond the project’s capacity, so the existing effort focuses on
actively supported lines.

> Why did the Node.js project issue a CVE for all EOL releases? Because we don’t have the resources to evaluate
every single past release to know which are vulnerable. For all of you who are asking, Node.js is run by volunteers.
We have enough funding to maintain the current releases, but nothing more. In other words, we are certain that all
those past Node.js releases are vulnerable or will soon be vulnerable. This CVE highlights that security risk for
your organization.

## The Purpose of These CVEs

In general, users run security scans on production environments. If an active Node.js version is flagged as vulnerable,
the scanner prompts an upgrade. However, if a user relies on an EOL version and the CVE does not list that version as
affected, the user might wrongly assume that their setup is secure.

The Node.js Technical Steering Committee (TSC) has discussed the continued issue of widespread downloads for EOL versions.
For instance, [the Node.js blog](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/upcoming-cve-for-eol-versions) notes that
Node.js v16, though EOL for over a year, still receives 11 million downloads per month. Issuing CVEs for EOL versions
is the most direct way to inform organizations that outdated releases are likely exposed to security risks.

## Recent Updates to These CVEs

Following discussions with the CVE Program, HackerOne, and Node.js, additional updates were requested for these EOL CVEs.
They are now tagged with “unsupported when assigned,” reflecting their EOL status, and marked as “disputed” to indicate
that they do not reference a specific vulnerability. A note was also added, stating that using the CVE List to report an
unsupported product is a novel approach under review by the CVE Program.

- **CVE-2025-23087** (v17 and prior)
- **CVE-2025-23088** (v19)
- **CVE-2025-23089** (v21)
