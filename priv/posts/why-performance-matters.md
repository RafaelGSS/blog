# Why performance matters?

Why do you must care about performance in your products? This question hiddes valueable insights.

As mentioned in my previous post about [_Performance Methodologies_](https://blog.rafaelgss.com.br/performance-methodologies):

> _"Poor performance costs the software industry millions of dollars annually in lost revenue, decreased productivity, increased development, hardware costs and damaged customer relations."_

// TODO: rephrase it
We are not accustomed to measuring our everyday encounters in milliseconds, but studies have shown that most of us will reliably report a perceptible "lag" once a delay of over 100-200 milliseconds is introduced into the system
Once the 300 milliseconds delay threshold is exceeded, the interaction is often reported as "sluggish" and at the 1000 milliseconds barrier,many users have already performed a mental context switch while waiting for the response.
The conclusion is simple: to deliver the best experience and keep our users engaged in the task at hand, we need to be fast!
