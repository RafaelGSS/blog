# Performance Methodologies

I've spent around of one year studing the _Performance_ methodologies and is fair to say that as everything on CS (Computer Science):

> _Performance is a field where the more you know, the more you don't know_.

Most of applications tend to focus on correctness instead of performance, it's common to care about performance when it becomes a problem.
Usually, when it happens you don't have so many time to work on it and this article will show you that: **there is no magic solution**.
A lot of work should be done before, this article will consider the reader as a Performance Engineer or someone that must perform work as one.

Before any performance analysis you **must** understand the application architecture. It should be performed with clear paths of dependencies and third-party services.

Have a clear diagram of software architecture is great start to move forward.

> The foundation of your software should be resilient to archive better results.
